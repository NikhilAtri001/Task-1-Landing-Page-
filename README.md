#✅ Task 1 Completed! 🎉
I’m excited to share that I have successfully completed the task of creating a responsive and visually appealing landing page as part of my learning journey given by Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
For this project, I designed and developed a Hocco Ice Cream landing page using HTML and CSS. The page includes:
 🍦 A hero section with a catchy headline and call-to-action
 🌟 Dropdown navigation menus for smooth user experience
 ✨ Feature section highlighting signature ice creams
 🎥 Embedded video section to engage visitors
 📩 Contact form for easy customer interaction
 ⚡ Smooth animations and a modern, friendly design
This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills and explore creative design elements.
